At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

I then carry out the analysis to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

First, we load the data.


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

I start by exploring the relationship between gender and salary.

The first step is to calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, I create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, it shows the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval

omega_gender <- omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_salary = sd(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_salary = sd_salary/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_salary,
            lower_CI = mean_salary - t_critical * se_salary,
            upper_CI = mean_salary + t_critical * se_salary
            )
omega_gender



```

Then I performed a hypothesis test to see whether our guess is true

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

#Null hypothesis: We assume difference between male and female mean_salary is zero.
#H0: mean1 = mean2

t.test(salary ~ gender,data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
dif_ob <- diff(omega_gender$mean_salary)  #calculate the observed difference
          
set.seed(1234)
dif_salary <- omega %>%
    specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
    hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
    generate(reps=1000, type="permute") %>% 
    calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("female", "male"))
  
dif_salary %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat= dif_ob,
              direction= "both")

#visualize the difference
dif_salary %>% 
  visualize() +
  theme_bw()


```


The difference between male and female average salary is statistically significant.We can reject the null hypothesis that males and females earn the same amount of salary.

Then we explore the relationship between gender and experience. 


```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
omega_experience <- favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

omega_experience
```


We cannot conclude here without seeing the CI and p-value but we can form an alternative hypothesis that there is a difference since the mean are relatively far apart.
```{r, experience_gender}
#Null hypothesis: We assume difference between male and female experience is zero.
#H0: mean1 = mean2

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package


dif<-diff(omega_experience$mean) #calculate the observed difference

dif_experience <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps=10000, type="permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("female", "male"))
  
dif_experience %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat= dif,
              direction= "both")

#visualize the difference
dif_experience %>% 
  visualize() +
  theme_bw()
```

Our analysis validates the hypothesized difference in male and female salaries since the p-values are statistically significant.


Next, we explore the relationship between salary and experience. 

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

cor.test(omega$salary, omega$experience)

omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=experience,y=salary,color=gender))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
 NULL

```


Last, we check correlation between the data.

I also used `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, I changed the order variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. I then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

 
 In general, there is a positive correlation between experience and salary. However, there seems to be more females in the sample with less experience and those with little experience can have different salary levels.
